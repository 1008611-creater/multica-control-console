# Douyin Video Selection

## Overview

Use this skill to decide what is worth making or publishing before spending editing time. Favor clips with a clear first-three-second hook, one emotional/job-to-be-done promise, and enough visual proof to support the copy.

## Intake

Collect or infer:

- Account persona and commercial goal.
- Target viewer and pain point.
- Available footage, draft videos, links, screenshots, or notes.
- Product/service/offer constraints.
- Platform risk areas: medical, finance, exaggerated income claims, copyrighted assets, minors, sensitive identity, or unsafe behavior.

If the user asks for market or trend research, use `jina-search` first when available. Keep research focused: one query per angle, prioritize official or high-signal pages, and return the reasoning rather than large copied text.

## Selection Method

1. List each candidate video or idea in one line.
2. Score with `references/selection-rubric.md`.
3. Pick one primary candidate and one backup.
4. Convert the winner into a production brief:

```markdown
选中素材：
推荐角度：
前三秒钩子：
观众痛点：
视频证明点：
剪辑方向：
风险/缺口：
下一步交给：
```

## Decision Rules

- Prefer specific scenes over abstract talking points.
- Prefer proof visible in the footage over claims that require explanation.
- Prefer one promise per video; split extra promises into future videos.
- Reject clips whose best caption would misrepresent what the viewer will see.
- If no candidate is strong enough, propose the minimum reshoot or missing asset list.
